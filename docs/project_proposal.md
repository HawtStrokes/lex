### Legal Expert System Project Proposal

#### **Project Name:**
Lex: A Legal Expert System for Business Law (Current version will only support the Philippines)

---

### **Relevant Constitutional Articles and Sections**

To develop Lex with a focus on Business Law, the following provisions from the 1987 Philippine Constitution are particularly relevant:

#### **1. Organization:**
- **Article XII: National Economy and Patrimony**
  - **Section 1**: Declares that the State shall protect Filipino enterprises against unfair foreign competition and trade practices.
  - **Section 2**: Mandates that the State shall promote the preferential use of Filipino labor, domestic materials, and locally produced goods, and adopt measures that will encourage the formation and operation of enterprises that are competitive in both domestic and foreign markets.

#### **2. Real Estate Laws:**
- **Article XII: National Economy and Patrimony**
  - **Section 2**: States that the ownership of land in the Philippines is limited to Filipino citizens and corporations or associations at least 60% of whose capital is owned by such citizens.
  - **Section 3**: Allows the State to transfer to private ownership lands of the public domain, subject to limitations prescribed by law.

#### **3. Contracts and Obligations:**
- **Article III: Bill of Rights**
  - **Section 10**: Ensures that no law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be passed.

#### **4. Taxation:**
- **Article VI: Legislative Department**
  - **Section 28**: Provides that the rule of taxation shall be uniform and equitable, and that Congress shall evolve a progressive system of taxation.

#### **Explanation of Key Files and Directories:**

1. **`app/` Directory:**
   - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the Flask app.
   - **`routes.py`**: Defines the endpoints and application logic.
   - **`models.py`**: Contains data models for database integration (if needed).
   - **`utils/inference_engine.py`**: Handles communication between the main Python app and CLIPS (using `clipspy`).

2. **`clips/` Directory:**
   - **`business_rules.clp`**: Stores CLIPS rules and facts for inference.

3. **`templates/` Directory:**
   - **`base.html`**: Base HTML template for reuse.
   - **`index.html`**: Main user interface for data input and result display.

4. **`static/` Directory:**
   - **`css/`**: Contains stylesheets.
   - **`js/`**: Contains JavaScript files for interactivity.
   - **`images/`**: Contains static images.

5. **`tests/` Directory:**
   - **`test_app.py`**: Unit tests for the application.

6. **`requirements.txt`**: Lists Python dependencies.

7. **`run.py`**: Entry point for running the Flask application.

8. **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.

### **Boilerplate Code**

#### **1. `run.py`**
```python
from app import create_app

app = create_app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

#### **2. `app/__init__.py`**
```python
from flask import Flask

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your-secret-key'

    from .routes import main
    app.register_blueprint(main)

    return app
```

#### **3. `app/routes.py`**
```python
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request, jsonify
from .utils.inference_engine import run_inference

main = Blueprint("main", __name__)

@main.route("/", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
    if request.method == "POST":
        user_data = request.form["data"]
        result = run_inference(user_data)
        return jsonify({"inference": result})

    return render_template("index.html")
```

#### **4. `app/utils/inference_engine.py`**
```python
import clips

def run_inference(user_input):
    env = clips.Environment()
    env.load("clips/business_rules.clp")

    # Add user input as facts
    env.assert_string(f"(user-input {user_input})")

    # Run inference
    env.run()

    # Collect results
    results = [str(fact) for fact in env.facts() if "inference" in str(fact)]
    return results
```

#### **5. `clips/business_rules.clp`**
```clips
(defrule example-rule
    (user-input ?input)
    =>
    (assert (inference (message "Example result based on" ?input))))
```
